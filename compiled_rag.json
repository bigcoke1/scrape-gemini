        "textual_response": "<p>Water is crucial for nearly every function in the human body, making up roughly two-thirds of our body weight. It supports metabolic reactions, helps form urine, composes the majority of sweat, and is a major component of blood plasma. Proper hydration is essential for many bodily functions, including brain function, muscle performance, joint health, gastrointestinal function, kidney function, heart function, blood volume regulation, gallbladder function, urinary tract health, skin health, and weight control. Adequate water intake also plays a vital role in situations requiring special consideration, such as air travel, cold weather, and extreme heat.  The best way to ensure proper hydration is to keep an eye on the color of your urine, with pale yellow indicating adequate hydration.<\/p>",

        "question": "how does photosynthesis work",
        "textual_response": "<p>Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and certain other organisms transform light energy into chemical energy. During photosynthesis, green plants use light energy to convert water and carbon dioxide into oxygen and energy-rich organic compounds.  This process is critical for the existence of the vast majority of life on Earth. Photosynthetic organisms form the base of Earth's food webs, and almost all of the oxygen in the atmosphere is due to this process. <\/p>\n<p>Photosynthesis is carried out in specialized organelles called chloroplasts, which contain the green pigment chlorophyll. Chlorophyll absorbs light energy, which is then used to split water molecules, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. The hydrogen atoms from water are then used to reduce carbon dioxide to form carbohydrates, such as glucose. <\/p>\n<p>The overall reaction of photosynthesis can be summarized as follows: <\/p>\n<p>6CO2 + 6H2O \u2192 C6H12O6 + 6O2 <\/p>\n<p>This equation indicates that six molecules of carbon dioxide and six molecules of water are converted into one molecule of glucose and six molecules of oxygen using light energy. <\/p>\n<p>The process of photosynthesis is divided into two stages: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Light-dependent reactions:<\/strong> These reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts and involve the absorption of light energy by chlorophyll. This energy is used to split water molecules and produce ATP and NADPH. <\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle):<\/strong> These reactions occur in the stroma of chloroplasts and use the energy stored in ATP and NADPH to convert carbon dioxide into carbohydrates.  <\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The rate of photosynthesis can be influenced by a number of factors, including: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Light intensity:<\/strong> The rate of photosynthesis increases with increasing light intensity until a point of saturation is reached. <\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Temperature:<\/strong> Photosynthesis has an optimal temperature range, and the rate of the process decreases at temperatures outside this range. <\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Carbon dioxide concentration:<\/strong> The rate of photosynthesis increases with increasing carbon dioxide concentration. <\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Water availability:<\/strong> Water is essential for photosynthesis, and the rate of the process decreases when water is scarce. <\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Photosynthesis is an essential process for life on Earth, providing the food and oxygen that we need to survive. <\/p>",
