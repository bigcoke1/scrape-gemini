        "textual_response": "<p>Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy. This chemical energy is stored in the form of glucose, a type of sugar that the organism can use for fuel. Photosynthesis occurs in two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions. In the light-dependent reactions, chlorophyll absorbs energy from sunlight and uses it to split water molecules into oxygen, hydrogen ions, and electrons. These electrons are then used to create ATP and NADPH, which are energy-carrying molecules. In the light-independent reactions, the ATP and NADPH from the light-dependent reactions are used to convert carbon dioxide into glucose. This process is also known as the Calvin cycle. Photosynthesis is essential for life on Earth as it provides the oxygen we breathe and the food we eat.<\/p>",
